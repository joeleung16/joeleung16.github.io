This is the presentation from the BYU SRC in 2019 where we developed what we call an "affinity score" which can be used to predict the formation of different communities within networks. We use Machine Learning algorithms to help with the prediction process, and normally rely on standard community detection algorithms to determine the communities within the networks of interest. This was also presented at the BYU Student Research Conference of 2019.
