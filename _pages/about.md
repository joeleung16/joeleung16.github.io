I am currently a Research Professional at the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute. I graduated from Brigham Young University studying Applied and Computational
Math with a second major in Economics. I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
in the summer of 2019, and also have done research in Network theory, Corporate Finance, and
Bankruptcy.

While this does serve as a "resume website page" I also use this as a bit of a personal corner for a number of pet projects that interest me. There's a lot to learn, and I feel that without a willingness to put ourselves out there, it can be hard to understand how much we actually know.



Below is my resume. For references or inquiries, please email me at joeleung16@outlook.com.
