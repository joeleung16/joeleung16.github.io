I am currently working at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a full-time research analyst in Financial Intermediation. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics with high honors. 

My current research interests are in international finance, corporate finance, trade, and macroeconomics.

In my free time, I play ultimate frisbee and chamber music with my friends. I am also a Dallas sports fan, primarily supporting the Dallas Mavericks (NBA) and Dallas Cowboys (NFL).

Here are some links of my piano performances and recordings: 
[Chopin Piano Concerto Op. 11 No. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZOwUwSWcqk), [Chopin Andante Spianato e Grande Polonaise Brilliante Op. 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyT-av_7LuY), [Dvorak "Dumky" Trio Excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFfCySsRKU)
