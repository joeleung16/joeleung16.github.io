**Abstract** (Work in progress)

In the past 20 years, many countries around the world have used capital control policies in response to financial crises, which in turn have consequences in economic growth and trade. Over the span of 1995-2014, we find evidence that for 99 countries, the effect of capital controls on trade vary across industries that have differing levels of external financing and collateral. Upon tightening capital controls, industries that rely more heavily on external financing suffer a larger decline in exports, and industries that possess more tangible assets suffer lesser decline in exports. We find that this effect is predominantly found in countries with low levels of financial development.
