In this International Economics seminar paper, I explore the Big Mac Index that was first introduced by the *Economist*. Furthermore, I explain how the Big Mac Index fits in with in international economics theory, such as purchasing power parity (absolute vs. relative) and non-traded goods. Then, I discuss the surrounding literature that uses the Big Mac Index in the purchasing power parity and exchange rate literature.
