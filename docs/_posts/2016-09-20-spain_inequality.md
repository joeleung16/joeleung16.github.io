A Sigma Xi poster on work by Jose-Antonio Espin-Sanchez, Salvador Gil-Giraldo, Daniel Giraldo-Paez, and Chris Vickers. I assisted by building the Floridablanca census and constructing preliminary figures and charts. I am no longer working on this project.

This Sigma Xi poster presented a preliminary overview of socioeconomic statuses in Spain during the 18th century, prior to NSF Grant Submission. The main idea is to build family trees and track changes in social status or wealth, using signifiers, such as "Don", occupation, and incomes. The preliminary data analysis comes from two historical censuses: the Ensenada (1754) and Floridablanca (1786) Censuses. In our analysis, we observe income, household size, occupation of parents and guardians, social status, and age, all manually inputed from the historical censuses.

Draft of [working paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tgoav6idoxzj8nu/Inequality.pdf?dl=0) by Jose-Antonio Espin-Sanchez, Salvador Gil-Giraldo, Daniel Giraldo-Paez, and Chris Vickers. 

As a sidebar, this was also my first exposure to economic research.
